This script does the following:

 *   Sources the ROS 2 environment.
 *   Opens multiple terminal windows using gnome-terminal.
 *   Starts the Turtlesim simulator.
 *   Controls the turtle's movement using velocity commands.
 *   Spawns a new turtle using a service call.
 *   Moves the new turtle in a square pattern using actions.
 *   Closes the terminal windows when the demonstration is complete.

Make sure to adapt this script to your specific ROS 2 installation and workspace paths as needed. You may need to modify the topic and service names or adjust the sleep times based on your system's performance.
